# MetaErg
MetaErg is a stand-alone and fully automated metagenome and metaproteome annotation pipeline. MetaErg bundles essential annotation tasks such as feature prediction, functional annotation with Hidden Markov Model (HMM) searches as well as blast and diamond searches. It estimates and visualizes quantitative taxonomic and pathway compositions of multiple metagenomic and proteomics samples using sequencing coverage and proteomics spectral counts, respectively. For visualization, MetaErg provides a HTML interface, bringing all annotation results together, and producing sortable and searchable tables, collapsible trees, and other graphic representations enabling intuitive navigation of complex data.
