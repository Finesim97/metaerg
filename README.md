# MetaErg
MetaErg is a stand-alone and fully automated metagenomic and metaproteomic data annotation pipeline. It bundles essential annotation tasks such as feature prediction, functional annotation with Hidden Markov Model (HMM) searches as well as blast and diamond searches. It estimates and visualizes quantitative taxonomic and pathway compositions of multiple metagenomic and proteomics samples using sequencing coverage and proteomics spectral counts, respectively. For visualization, MetaErg provides a HTML interface, bringing all annotation results together, and producing sortable and searchable tables, collapsible trees, and other graphic representations enabling intuitive navigation of complex data.

MetaErg analysis output demo page can be access at: https://xiaoli-dong.github.io/metaerg/

# Required perl modules
MetaErg was developed using perl, html, and javascript. It requires Perl 5.6.0 or higher and runs on Linux platform. Besides the perl core modules, it also requires the following perl modules to be installed:
```

* Bio::Perl;
* Bio::DB::EUtilities
* DBD::SQLite
* DBI;
* File::Copy::Recursive
* LWP::Protocol::https

# Running with docker
MetaErg docker image is host on the docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/xiaolidong/docker-metaerg. Due to licences permissions, this image does not contain [SignalP](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/cgi-bin/nph-sw_request?signalp) and [TMHMM](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/cgi-bin/nph-sw_request?tmhmm). When running with docker image, "--sp --tm" options cannot be enabled.

# Using the downloaded prebuilt database or build database using MetaErg supplied script. Building the database process will take a while to run:
docker run --shm-size 2g --rm -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -it -v my_local_dir:/data/ docker-metaerg setup_db.pl -o /data -v 132

#Running MetaErg with default options
docker run --shm-size 2g --rm -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -it -v my_local_dir:/data/ docker-metaerg metaerg.pl --dbdir /data/db /data/contig.fasta
```

# Installation
```
# Install metaerg to your home directory
git clone https://github.com/xiaoli-dong/metaerg.git $HOME/metaerg

# Using the downloaded prebuilt database
# or build database using MetaErg supplied script and the building process will take a while to run
$HOME/metaerg/bin/setup_db.pl -o $HOME -v 132
```

# Quick start:
The functionality provided by MetaErg can be accessed through the help menu:
```
>perl $HOME/metaerg/bin/metaerg.pl --help
```
Running MetaErg with the default parameters will output the final and intermediate results into a directory named metaerg.pl_ddmmyyyy directory
```
>perl $HOME/metaerg/bin/metaerg.pl --dbdir $home/db contig.fasta
```
Running MetaErg with user defined output directory and file names
```
>perl $HOME/metaerg/bin/metaerg.pl --dbdir $home/db --outdir mydir --prefix mycontigs contig.fasta
```
With a user provided depth file, MetaErg can quantify the taxonomic, functional, and pathway compositions of multiple metagenomic samples. An example depth file was included in the "example" direcotry and it was genereated using "jgi_summarize_bam_contig_depths" from [MetaBat](https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/metabat) using BAM files, which are created by aligning the reads of each metagenomic sample separately to the contigs
```
>perl $HOME/metaerg/bin/metaerg.pl --dbdir $home/db --depth demo.depth.txt demo.fasta
```
With a user provided protein expression level profile, MetaErg can also quantify functional, pathway profiles based on the active expressed protein genes from the metagenomic samples. An example protein expression profile was also included in the "example".
```
>perl $HOME/metaerg/bin/metaerg.pl --dbdir $home/db --plevel demo.proteomics.txt demo.fna
```
# Utility scripts
MetaErg includes some utility perl scripts and they can be used to filter contigs by lenght, add bin ids to the predicated coding sequecnes, and generate input for VizBin program: 
```
#Filter out contig sequences shorter than 500bp
>perl $HOME/metaerg/bin/filterContigByLength.pl contig.fasta 500
```
Assume "mybindir" conatins all bin files and each fasta format bin file contains all the contigs binned togeher. The bins files are named in the format of Bin.binid.fa. In the file name, the binid is the bin id number.  The following command can generate input files for VisBin program for visualizing the binning results.
```
>perl $HOME/metaerg/bin/getVizBinInput.pl -d mybindir
```
The above command writes two files into the "mybindir":  "binned_concat.fasta" and "binned_annotation.list". In the VizBin application, the "binned_concat.fasta" can be uploaded to "File to Visualize" field and "binned_annotation.list" can be loaded to "Annotation file(optional)" field.

MetaErg can also extract the subset of annotation results and produce html summary pages from the previous total annotation without redoing the annnotion:
```
#Step1, extracting the gff format annotations for the contigs included in "subset.fasta" from the total metaerg dataset annotation:
>perl $HOME/metaerg/bin/fastaContig2Gff.pl -c subset.fasta -g mydir/data/master.gff  > subset.gff

#Step 2, generating the html reports for the extracted contig subset
>perl $HOME/metaerg/bin/output_reports.pl  -g subset.gff -f subset.fasta -o mysubsetdir
```
Let's assume mybindir contains all the binning files: Bin.1.fa", "Bin.2.fa", "Bin.3.fa"... files. The following commands will: 

```
#Add bin id to the fasta format of the protein coding sequence and protein coding sequence id will be in the format of "binid_geneid"  
>perl $HOME/metaerg/bin/add_binid2cds.pl -d binning -c mydir/data/cds.faa -g mydir/data/master.gff

# Add bin ids to master.tsv file  as the first column
>perl $HOME/metaerg/bin/add_binid2master_dot_tsv.pl -d binning -t mydir/data/master.tsv
```
# MeteErg output directory layout
MetaErg writes the output files into a user defined or MetaErg autogenerated output directory. The following is an example of the MetaErg output file structure layout:

| Output        | Description|
|:--- |:--- |
| \*.fna | Reformated and filtered fasta format input contig sequences |
| data | A directory contains all the MetaErg generated annotation summary files in differenct formats. Although the files have different suffix, they are all text files, whch can be opened in any text editor |
| html | A directory contains all the HTML pages for various type of  HTML reports |
| images | A directory contains all the image files for the html reports such as logo, banner|
| index.html | An interactive HTML report, which links all the MetaErg annotation results together |
| js | A directory contains all the required Javascript libraries for the interactive html reports |
| style.css | A HTML style sheet, which controls the look of the html reports |
| tmp | A dirctory contains all the MetaErg intermediate outputs. It is also useful when MetaErg fails in the middle of the run. With this directory in place, when you restart the job using the exact same parameters after MetaErg failling, MetaErg will start from the place it failed.  After MetaErg job finishes successfully, this directory can be deleted before you transfer the results to your local computers|
