# MetaErg
MetaErg is a stand-alone and fully automated metagenome and metaproteome annotation pipeline. MetaErg bundles essential annotation tasks such as feature prediction, functional annotation with Hidden Markov Model (HMM) searches as well as blast and diamond searches. It estimates and visualizes quantitative taxonomic and pathway compositions of multiple metagenomic and proteomics samples using sequencing coverage and proteomics spectral counts, respectively. For visualization, MetaErg provides a HTML interface, bringing all annotation results together, and producing sortable and searchable tables, collapsible trees, and other graphic representations enabling intuitive navigation of complex data.

## Running MetaErg

Let's assume you are in the "example" direcoty of the MetaErg installation 

\# Checking MetaErg's command line options

> perl ../bin/metaerg.pl --help

\# Running MetaErg with default parameters

> perl ../bin/metaerg.pl test.fasta

\# Running MetaErg with signal peptide and cleavage site and transmembrane helics predication enabled. MetaErg will be slow down with those two feature enabled

> perl ../bin/metaerg.pl --sp --tm test.fasta

\# Running MetaErg with all the output to a user defined directory. By default, MetaErg will generate a output directory in the format of "locusttag_timestamp"

> perl ../bin/metaerg.pl --sp --tm --outdir metaerg_out --prefix test --locustag metaerg_test test.fasta

\# Overwrite previous results with --force option

> perl  ../bin/metaerg.pl  --force test.fasta

\# Running MetaErg with user provided coverage profile. With this supplied coverage profile, MetaErg will generate quantitative taxonomic, functional, and pathway compositions of multiple metagenomic samples.  The coverage profile must be in a well defined format in order for MetaErg  program to parse it correctly. For the required coverage profile format, you can refer to "cyano.depth.txt" file included in the "example" directory of the MetaErg installation. The example file can be generated using "**jgi_summarize_bam_contig_depths**" command from [MetaBat](https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/metabat) program after you finish the short reads to contig mapping process.

>perl ../bin/metaerg.pl --outdir metaerg_cyano --prefix cyano --locustag cyano --sp --tm --depth cyano.depth.txt cyano.fna

\# Running MetaErg with with user provided protein expression level profile. With protein expression level profile provided, MetaErg will generate functional, pathway profiles based on the proteins expressed in the metagenomic samples. For the required protein expression profile format, you can refer to "cyano.proteomics.txt" file included in the "example" of the MetaErg installation.

>perl ../bin/metaerg.pl --outdir cyano --prefix cyano --locustag cyano --sp --tm --depth cyano.depth.txt --plevel cyano.proteomics.txt cyano.fna

##Utility scripts

MetaErg also includes some utility scripts to filtering contigs, add bin ids to the coding sequecnes, generate input for VizBin program. Some of the examples are listed as below:

##### Filter out fasta format sequences shorter than a defined length ####

> perl ../bin/filterContigByLength.pl test.fasta 500

The above command filters out the sequences shorter than 500bp from the input test.fasta file

##### Generate input files for VisBin program to visualize binning results ##########

>perl ../bin/getVizBinInput.pl -d binning_dir

The "binning_dir" contains all the bin files. Each bin file is named in the format of "Bin.binid.fa" and binid is a number. Each bin file contains all the contigs binned together. The above command writes two files into the "binning_dir":  "binned_concat.fasta" and "binned_annotation.list".  In the VizBin application, the "binned_concat.fasta" will be uploaded to "File to Visualize" field and "binned_annotation.list" will be loaded to "Annotation file(optional)" field.

##### Extract MetaErg annotations for a subset of input contig sequences #####

Let's assume you are in the "example" directory of the MetaErg installation and "subset.fasta" file contains a subset of contig sequences from "cyano.fasta" file. The following two commands will generate the html reports for the contigs included in "subset.fasta" file

\# Step1, extracting the annotations belonging to all the contigs contained in "subset.fasta" in gff format :

>perl ../bin/fastaContig2Gff.pl -c subset.fasta -g cyano/data/master.gff  > subset.gff

\# Step 2, generating the annotation results and html reports to "metaerg_subset_output"

>perl ../bin/output_reports.pl  -g subset.gff -f subset.fasta -o metaerg_subset_output

##### Add bin ids to the MetaErg generated fiiles #####

Let's assume you are in "example" directory of the MetaErg installation and your binning results are in the "binning" directory.  "Bin.1.fa", "Bin.2.fa",  and "Bin.3.fa" files sitting in the "binning" directory contain all the fasta format contig sequences belonging to bin1, bin2, and bin3, respectivly.  

\# Add bin id to the front of the protein coding sequence id in the format of "binid_" 

>perl ../bin/add_binid2cds.pl -d binning -c cyano/data/cds.faa -g cyano/data/master.gff

\# Add bin ids to master.tsv file  as the first column

>perl ../bin/add_binid2master_dot_tsv.pl -d binning -t cyano/data/master.tsv

## MeteErg outputs
MetaErg writes all the output files into a user defined or MetaErg generated output directory. The following is an example of the MetaErg output file structure layout:

[[img src=metaerg_output_home.png alt=MetaErg_output_fist_level_layout]]

| Output        | Description|
|: --- |: --- |
| cyan.fna | Reformated and filtered fasta format input contig sequences |
| data | A directory contains all the MetaErg generated annotation summary files in differenct formats. Although the files have different suffix, they are all text files, whch can be opened in any text editor |
| html | A directory contains all the HTML pages for various type of  HTML reports |
| images | A directory contains all the image files for the html reports such as logo, banner|
| index.html | An interactive HTML report, which links all the MetaErg annotation results together |
| js | A directory contains all the required Javascript libraries for the interactive html reports |
| style.css | A HTML style sheet, which controls the look of the html reports |
| tmp | A dirctory contains all the MetaErg intermediate outputs. It is also useful when MetaErg fails in the middle of the run. With this directory in place, when you restart the job using the exact same parameters after MetaErg failling, MetaErg will start from the place it failed.  After MetaErg job finishes successfully, this directory can be deleted before you transfer the results to your local computers|
