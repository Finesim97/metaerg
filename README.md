# MetaErg
MetaErg is a stand-alone and fully automated metagenomic and metaproteomic data annotation pipeline. It bundles essential annotation tasks such as feature prediction, functional annotation with Hidden Markov Model (HMM) searches as well as blast and diamond searches. It estimates and visualizes quantitative taxonomic and pathway compositions of multiple metagenomic and proteomics samples using sequencing coverage and proteomics spectral counts, respectively. For visualization, MetaErg provides a HTML interface, bringing all annotation results together, and producing sortable and searchable tables, collapsible trees, and other graphic representations enabling intuitive navigation of complex data.

MetaErg reference DB can be downloaded:
```
# Retrieve the prebuilt database
wget http://ebg.ucalgary.ca/metaerg/db.tar.gz -P $HOME

```
or build the reference DB using the metaerg supplied script (see running with docker and installation sections). 

# Running with docker
MetaErg docker image is host on the docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/xiaolidong/docker-metaerg. Due to licences permissions, this image does not contain [SignalP](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/cgi-bin/nph-sw_request?signalp) and [TMHMM](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/cgi-bin/nph-sw_request?tmhmm)

# Installation
```
#This command will install metaerg to your home directory
git clone https://github.com/xiaoli-dong/metaerg.git $HOME/metaerg

# Using the downloaded prebuilt database or build database using MetaErg supplied script. Building the database process will take a while to run:
$HOME/metaerg/bin/setup_db.pl -o $HOME -v 132
```


# MetaErg Usages:
Checke MetaErg's command line options
```
>perl $HOME/metaerg/bin/metaerg.pl --help
```
Running MetaErg with the default parameters. 
```
#MetaErg outputs the results and intermediate results into metaerg.pl_yyyymmdd directory
>perl $HOME/metaerg/bin/metaerg.pl contig.fasta
```
Running MetaErg with the signal peptide and transmembrane helics predication features enabled
```
#By default, --sp and --tm options were disabled. Enable them will slow down metaerg annotation process
>perl $HOME/metaerg/bin/metaerg.pl --sp --tm contig.fasta
```
```
#Running MetaErg with user defined output file names and output directory
>perl $HOME/metaerg/bin/metaerg.pl --outdir mydir --prefix mydata contig.fasta
```
```
#Generate quantitative taxonomic, functional, and pathway compositions of multiple metagenomic samples with user provided coverage input
>perl $HOME/metaerg/bin/metaerg.pl --depth demo.depth.txt contig.fasta
```
The coverage profile must be in a well defined format in order for MetaErg  program to parse it correctly. For the required coverage profile format, you can refer to "demo.depth.txt" file included in the "example" directory of the MetaErg installation. The example file can be generated using "**jgi_summarize_bam_contig_depths**" command from [MetaBat](https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/metabat) program after you finish the short reads to contig mapping process.
```
#generate functional, pathway profiles based on the active expressed protein genes in the metagenomic samples
>perl $HOME/metaerg/bin/metaerg.pl --plevel demo.proteomics.txt demo.fna
```
With user provided protein expression level profile, MetaErg will generate functional, pathway profiles based on the proteins expressed in the metagenomic samples. For the required protein expression profile format, you can refer to "demo.proteomics.txt" file included in the "example" direcotory of the MetaErg installation.
# MetaErg utility scripts
MetaErg also includes some utility scripts to filtering contigs, add bin ids to the coding sequecnes, generate input for VizBin program. Some of the examples are listed as below:
```
#Filter out fasta format sequences shorter than a defined length
>perl $HOME/metaerg/bin/filterContigByLength.pl contig.fasta 500
```
The above command filters out the contigs <500bp from contig.fasta file
```
#Generate input files for VisBin program to visualize binning results
>perl $HOME/metaerg/bin/getVizBinInput.pl -d binning_dir
```
The "binning_dir" contains all the bin files. Each bin file is named in the format of "Bin.binid.fa" and binid is a number. Each bin file contains all the contigs binned together. The above command writes two files into the "binning_dir":  "binned_concat.fasta" and "binned_annotation.list".  In the VizBin application, the "binned_concat.fasta" will be uploaded to "File to Visualize" field and "binned_annotation.list" will be loaded to "Annotation file(optional)" field.
# Extract the subset of the MetaErg annotation results
Step1, extracting the annotations belonging to all the contigs contained in "subset.fasta" in gff format from the total dataset annotation :
```
#the total annotations are in mydir direcotry and the subset.fasta is a subset of the total input sequences to MetaErg annnotation
>perl $HOME/metaerg/bin/fastaContig2Gff.pl -c subset.fasta -g mydir/data/master.gff  > subset.gff
```
Step 2, generating the annotation results and html reports for the subset sequences
```
>perl $HOME/metaerg/bin/output_reports.pl  -g subset.gff -f subset.fasta -o mysubsetdir
```
# Add bin ids to the MetaErg generated files
Let's assume you are in "example" directory of the MetaErg installation and your binning results are in the "binning" directory.  "Bin.1.fa", "Bin.2.fa",  and "Bin.3.fa" files sitting in the "binning" directory contain all the fasta format contig sequences belonging to bin1, bin2, and bin3, respectivly.  
```
#Add bin id to the front of the protein coding sequence id in the format of "binid_" 
>perl $HOME/metaerg/bin/add_binid2cds.pl -d binning -c mydir/data/cds.faa -g mydir/data/master.gff
```
```
# Add bin ids to master.tsv file  as the first column
>perl $HOME/metaerg/bin/add_binid2master_dot_tsv.pl -d binning -t mydir/data/master.tsv
```
